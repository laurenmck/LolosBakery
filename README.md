# Introduction 

For this lab, I created a simple react app to familiarize myself with the basic concepts and principles of react. I designed and built a simple bakery interface that displays a scrollable, interactive bakery menu and allows users to add items to a cart, view cart items, and view the total cart price.

**Project Duration:** ~2-4 hrs <br>
**Project Type:** Solo lab for User Interface User Experience course (cs1300) @ Brown University <br>
