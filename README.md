# Introduction 

For this lab, I created a simple react app to farmiliarize myself with the basic concepts and principles of react. I designed and built a simple bakery interface that displays a scrollable, interactive bakery menu and allows users to add items to a cart, view cart items and view the total cart price.

**Project Durration:** ~2-4 hrs <br>
